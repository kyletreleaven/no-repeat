\section*{}

The problem is as follows:

Find the minimum number $k$ of piles of $N > 0$ items, so that no pile obtains more than $n > 0$ items.
%

Another way to phrase the problem is:

Find $\min k \in \integers$ such that $\left\lceil N / k \right\rceil \leq n$, where $N, n > 0$.

Without the ceiling function, the exercise is completely trivial, i.e., find $\min k \in {\mathbb Z}$ such that $N / k \leq n$,
for which the solution is obviously $k = \left\lceil N / n \right\rceil$.
%
The original problem is not fundamentally harder, but technically annoying.
There are also occasions when the second more general form should be solved where $N, n > 0$ need not be integers.
We will consider this case.

Actually, for convenience we will lift the analysis to an even more general problem:

Find the minimum $x \in \integers$ such that $\left\lceil f(x) \right\rceil \leq \gamma$, where
$f$ is any positive, strictly decreasing function with an inverse $f^{-1}$ on the domain of interest, and
$\gamma > 0$.

We use the fact that $\lceil x \rceil \leq y \mutual x \leq \lfloor y \rfloor$ to equate the prior problem to:
find the minimum $x \in \integers$ such that $f(x) \leq \lfloor \gamma \rfloor$.
Due to the monotonicity of $f$, this condition is equivalent to $x \geq f^{-1}\left( \lfloor \gamma \rfloor \right)$.
Obviously, the smallest integer satisfying this condition is
\[
	x^* = \left\lceil f^{-1}\left( \lfloor \gamma \rfloor \right) \right\rceil.
\]

Substituting the appropriate specifics back into this equation, we obtain
\[
	x^* = \left\lceil \frac{ N }{ \lfloor n \rfloor } \right\rceil.
\]
